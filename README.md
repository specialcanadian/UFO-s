# Module 11 Challenge

## Project description 
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage which accesses a dataset of UFO sightings. Five filters are present on the webpage which allow users to search for sightings by date, location, or shape 
 
## Results
As an example, you could use the Date filter to see all the UFO sightings in California. 
The filters are located near the bottom of the page

Multiple filters can also be applied at the same

## Summary
One drawback of this website would be trying to add data in a different format would be difficult. The JS code is needs data formatting just like data.js

My first recommendation for additional development would be a button that filters results by using your current location. 

My second recommendation would be finding a dataset which includes images for some of the sightings. Most likey, many UFO sightings are only reported verbally, so the code would need to be able to handle sightings with and without photos, and still run properly
